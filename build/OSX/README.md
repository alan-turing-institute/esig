## Building esig for OSX

It is not straightforward (and arguably not legal) to run OSX in a Docker
container, so the procedure here is run directly on a Mac, using
Python virtualenv environments.

### Prerequisites

- ensure `brew` installed
- ensure `libalgebra` submodule has been cloned

### To build on OSX

Run the literate script `build-wheels.sh`.
