## esig_builder

[esig](http://esig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a python package
written by Terry Lyons et al., for transforming vector time series in
stream space to signatures in effect space.

This package contains helper scripts and dockerfiles to help build the
package (i.e. create pre-compiled python ***wheels***) for different
architectures and python versions.

There are subdirectories in this repo for Linux, OSX, and Windows.  Please see
the README.md in each of those for instructions on building for that
OS.
